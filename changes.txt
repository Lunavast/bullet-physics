Bullet Continuous Collision Detection and Physics Library
Erwin Coumans

2006 Dec 8, Erwin Coumans
	- preparation for SIMD: added btAlignedAllocator and btAlignedObjectArray, to replace stl std::vector, same interface, but compatible with 16 byte alignment
	- cleaned up dependencies in autogenerated msvc projectfiles
	- aligned btVector3 on 16 bytes boundary, under win32. see if developers will come up with problems

2006 Dec 04, Erwin Coumans
	Added btNearCallback. This is similar to Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) dNearCallback, but important differences:
	- contact points are persistent (lifetime more then one frame, for warmstarting/incremental contact point management)
	- continuous collision detection, time of impact
	Added btRigidBody::isInWorld(), returns true if btRigidBody is inside a btCollisionWorld/btDynamicsWorld derived class
	Added angularFactor to btRigidbody, this helps some character control (no angular impulse applied)


2006 Nov 28
	Moved StackAlloc from EPA into LinearMath/btStackAlloc
	renamed internal class ConcaveShape into btConcaveShape
	added btHeightfieldTerrainShape (not completed yet)
		
2006 Nov 15 Nathanael Presson
	Added EPA penetration depth algorithm, Expanding Polytope Algorithm
	Added Pierre Terdiman penetration depth comparison/test DEMO
	Fixed Bullet's Minkowski sampling penetration depth solver
	Contributed by Nathanael Presson
	
2006 Nov 11 Francisco León Nájera
	Added GIMPACT trimesh collision detection: concave versus concave,
	Contributed by Francisco León Nájera

2006 Nov 2
	Minor refactoring: btCollisionObject changes from struct into class, added accessor methods
	Force use of btMotionState to synchronize graphics transform, disabled old btRigidBody constructor that accepts btTransform
	Renamed treshold into threshold throughout the code
	
2006 Oct 30
	Enable decoupling of physics and graphics framerate using interpolation and internal fixed timestep, based on btMotionState
	Enabled raycast vehicle demo (still needs tuning)
	Refresh contact points, even when they are already persistent.
	Fixed debugDraw colors (thanks pc0de for reporting)
	Use Dispatcher in ConcaveConvexCollisionAlgorithm (so it uses the registered collision algorithm, not hardcoded convexconcave)
	Improved performance of constraint solver by precalculating the cross product/impulse arm
	Added collision comparison code: ODE box-box, also sphere-triangle
	Added safety check into GJK, and an assert for AABB's that are very large
	Fixed kinematic support (deriving velocities for animated objects)
	Updated comparison/optional quickstep solver in Extras
	UserCollisionAlgorithm demonstrates btTriangleMesh usage (easier trimesh compared to index array version)
	Removed scaling from btTransform (we only want to deal with rigid transforms)
	
2006 Oct 4
	Fixed minor leak in btOptimizeBVH
	Cleanup of btRigidBody construction
	added getW() in btQuaternion
	assert when setLinearVelocity is called on btRigidBody
	renamed projectfile library from collada-dom to colladadom (to make VC6 happy)
	
2006 Sept 27
	Big Refactoring: renamed and moved files, create a replacement for CcdPhysicsEnvironment/CcdPhysicsController.
	All Bullet classes in LinearMath, BulletCollision and BulletDynamics start with bt, and methods start with lowercase.
	Moved classes into src folder, which is the only include folder needed.
	Added 2 headerfiles in src: btBulletCollisionCommon.h and btBulletDynamicsCommon.h

2006 Sept 23
	Fixed 2 bugs, causing crashes when removing objects. Should do better unit-testing. UnionFind and 3D SAP were involved.
	
2006 Sept 19
	Allow programmable friction and contact solver model. User can register their own functions for several interaction types.
	Improved performance, and removed hardcoded maximum overlaps (switched from C-array to stl::set)
	
2006 Sept 16
	Added Bullet 2.0  User Manual

2006 Sept 4
	Fixed concave collision bug (caused instability/missing collisions in meshes/compounds)
	Fixed memoryleak in OptimizedBvh, added RayTestSingle to CollisionWorld
	Prepared for VehicleDemo

	Just run cmake . in the root folder and it will autogenerate build files
	
2006 July 26 Erwin Coumans
	Upgraded to COLLADA-DOM 1.4.1, latest SVN version
	ColladaDemo can export snapshots to .dae
	
2006 July 24 Erwin Coumans
	Added Compound CollisionShape support
	(this is still low performance -> requires stackless tree-versus-tree traversal for better performance)

2006 July 15 Erwin Coumans
	Added initial support for Parallel execution (collision detection, constraint solving)
	See ParallelPhysicsEnvironment in Extras\PhysicsInterface\CcdPhysics
	
2006 July 10 Erwin Coumans
