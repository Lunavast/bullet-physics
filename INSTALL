Bullet Collision Detection and Physics Library

Building: read the Bullet_User_Manual.pdf or:

Under Windows, projectfiles for Visual Studio version 6,7,7.1 and 8 are available in msvc/<version>.
For example, for Visual Studio 2005, open msvc/8/wksbullet.sln

The ColladaDemo and ConvexDecomposition demo needs to be able to locate the data files (jenga.dae and file.obj) in the current directory. Make sure Visual Studio points to the right folder (..\..).

Alternatively you can use Cmake for all platforms including Win32, Mac OS X (PPC/Intel), Linux, BSD etc. 
Cmake allows to autogenerate MSVC, Xcode, Kdevelop, UNIX Makefiles etc:
Download cmake from http://cmake.org
./cmake . -G Xcode
You can replace Xcode by other available build systems. Just run cmake to see which are available for your platform.

Two more options: make and jam.

./autogen.sh

./configure

jam 
or 
make

If jam is not available for your system, you can compile it, jam sources are included with the Bullet sources in jam-2.5

compiling jam:

cd jam-2.5

make

(as root)

sudo ./jam0 install
